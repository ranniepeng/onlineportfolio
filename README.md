# About Me
Hi, I am Ran, a second-year student of the [MAM Program](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/arts-management-master/). I am passionate about visual arts, especially photography. Feel free to browse my photo works(and follow me :laughing:) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ranerpaidoupaile/)!
# What I Hope to Learn :book:
Throughout this class, I would love to learn the design theories and rationales behind data visualization and get practice on GitHub and Tableau on creating data visual dashboards. I would also like to know how to create more accessible data visualization for the general public (viewers who do not necessarily of certain academic backgrounds) I also want to learn new and some cool data visual tools or graphics that I previously did not know about and eventually learning how to use data to tell good and straightforward stories to the audiences.
